        <h1>Henry Paul</h1>
        <p>My name is Henry, and I have a strong passion for coding. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by computers — how they work, how websites are made, and how technology connects the world
            Right now, I’m learning to become a front-end developer, and I’m enjoying every step of the journey. I love creating clean designs, improving my skills, and turning ideas into real, working websites. I’m excited to keep learning, keep building, and grow as a developer.

        </h3>
        <p>I enjoy building projects that help me improve my skills and explore new ideas. Each project I work on teaches me something new — whether it’s understanding HTML structure, styling with CSS, adding interactivity with JavaScript, or organizing everything on GitHub.</p>
